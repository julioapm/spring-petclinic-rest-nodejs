# spring-petclinic-rest-nodejs
REST version of the Spring Petclinic sample application using Node.js and Express


This backend version of the Spring Petclinic application only provides a REST API. There is no UI. The spring-petclinic-angular project is a Angular front-end application witch consumes the REST API.

This is a rewrite of spring-petclinic-rest, using Node.js and Express, developed by Julio as demonstration of typed JavaScript practices.
